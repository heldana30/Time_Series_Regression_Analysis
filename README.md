# Sales Trends Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze sales trends and identify key patterns in the sales data of a retail store chain. The primary goals are to determine the peak and low sales dates for each year, examine the impact of promotions on sales, and understand the sales dynamics across different product families and store clusters. The analysis leverages Python's Polars library for efficient data manipulation and Seaborn for data visualization.
